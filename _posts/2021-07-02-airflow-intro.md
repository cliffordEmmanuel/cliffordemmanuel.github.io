## Basic description 


Apache airflow is a platform for authoring, scheduling and monitoring workflows. It is useful in architecting and orchestrating data pipelines. You can think of it like an upgrade on cron jobs.
All workflows are represented as **Directed Acyclic Graphs(DAGs)** which can be thought of as a collection of tasks.

## Airflow DAGs concept:


A created DAG would specify the dependecies between Tasks, and the order of their execution, and number retries that should happen. A task represents each node of a DAG and the actual work done each task represents is defined by operators. A task can be created for fetching data, running analysis, triggering other systems, or more.
So basic characteristics of a DAG are:
 - Directed: each task must have at least one defined upstream or downstream task.
 - Acyclic: This means that no single task should point back to itself as we don't want to create infinite loops.

## Control Flow


As the case with regular pipelines, Dags are designed such that they can be run multiple times. 
They can also be parameterised. Since a Dag is usually a collection of several tasks, these tasks have dependencies declared on each other. You’ll see this in a DAG either using the **>>** and **<<** operators.


## Operators:
They define what a particular task should do. There are 3 main operators:
 - Action operators: they execute a function eg PythonOperator or BashOperator
 - Transfer operators: move data between different sources
 - Sensor Operators: they wait for something to happen.


### Hierarchical view:

## Basic python script


All Dags are created using python code and below is an example of a basic script:

```python
"""
Example DAG 
"""
from datetime import datetime

from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.dummy import DummyOperator
from airflow.utils.edgemodifier import Label

with DAG(
    "example_branch_labels"
    , schedule_interval="@daily"
    , start_date=datetime(2021, 1, 1)
    , catchup=False
) as dag:
    ingest = DummyOperator(task_id="ingest")
    transform = DummyOperator(task_id="transform")
    load = DummyOperator(task_id="load")
    
    ingest >> transform >> load

if __name__ == "__main__":
    dag.cli()

```
