I spent my early career in data engineering, specializing in scalable pipelines and cloud infrastructure for data-intensive applications. 

Working at the edge of distributed computation and performance optimization taught me that the reliability of an AI system is only as strong as its underlying data foundation. 

Driven by a desire to make these systems more resilient, I am now focused on researching the systemic pillars of trustworthy AI. 

I aim to bridge the gap between large-scale data engineering and responsible AI to build infrastructures that are robust by design.
