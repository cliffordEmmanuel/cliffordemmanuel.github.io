With a professional background in data engineering, I have worked extensively on architecting scalable data pipelines and cloud-native infrastructure for data-intensive applications. This experience exposed me to the complexities of distributed computation, fault tolerance, performance optimization, and the foundational role of data quality and system reliability in AI-driven systems.

Driven by these challenges, I am transitioning into research to investigate the foundations that enable trustworthy AI. My interests lie at the intersection of large-scale data systems and responsible AI in real-world environments.

I aim to contribute to research that advances the development of AI systems that are not only scalable and high-performing, but also resilient, interpretable, and trustworthy by design.
