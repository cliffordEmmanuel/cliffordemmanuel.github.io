Early diagnosis can save lives, but traditional methods of risk assessment often depend on limited clinical tests or subjective interpretation. With the growing availability of health data, I wanted to explore whether <strong>machine learning (ML) techniques</strong> could assist in predicting heart disease risk more accurately.</p> <p>This post summarizes my project: applying different ML algorithms to a clinical dataset to see how well they could predict the presence of heart disease.</p> <h2 id="the-dataset">The Dataset</h2> <p>I used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle containing <strong>1,025 anonymized patient records</strong>. Each record included <strong>13 clinical features</strong> (like age, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, ECG results, maximum heart rate, etc.) and a target label indicating whether the patient had heart disease.</p> <p>Why this dataset?</p> <ul> <li>It’s a standard benchmark for healthcare ML experiments.</li> <li>The size (1k+ records) is manageable yet complex enough to apply multiple techniques.</li> <li>It includes both categorical and numerical features, which means meaningful preprocessing steps are required.</li> </ul> <h2 id="approach">Approach</h2> <p>I followed a typical <strong>data science workflow</strong>:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong></p> <ul> <li>Visualized feature distributions and checked correlations.</li> <li>Found that some features (e.g., chest pain type, thalassemia, maximum heart rate) strongly correlated with heart disease.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Preprocessing:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Handled categorical features through encoding.</li> <li>Scaled numerical features to a common range to help algorithms like SVM and KNN.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Modeling:</strong> I compared four algorithms:</p> <ul> <li>Logistic Regression (baseline)</li> <li>Random Forest (ensemble method)</li> <li>K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)</li> <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM with RBF kernel)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Evaluation:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Used accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.</li> <li>Applied <strong>5-fold cross-validation</strong> and <strong>GridSearchCV</strong> for hyperparameter tuning.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <h2 id="results">Results</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Random Forest</strong> was the clear winner, achieving <strong>~99.7% accuracy</strong> and perfect scores on precision, recall, and F1.</li> <li><strong>SVM</strong> also performed strongly with ~91.7% accuracy and high ROC-AUC.</li> <li>Logistic Regression and KNN gave reasonable baselines but underperformed compared to ensemble methods.</li> </ul> <p>Interestingly, the most predictive features included:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Chest pain type</strong> (certain types highly associated with disease).</li> <li><strong>Maximum heart rate achieved</strong> (higher stress response linked to risk).</li> <li><strong>Number of major vessels</strong> and <strong>thalassemia type</strong> (clear clinical indicators).</li> </ul> <h2 id="insights">Insights</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Ensemble models like Random Forest excelled</strong> because they can capture complex feature interactions without heavy assumptions.</li> <li><strong>Cross-validation was critical</strong> — early models showed near-perfect scores that looked like overfitting, but validation confirmed generalizability.</li> <li>Some findings challenged medical intuition, such as younger patients showing more heart disease in this dataset. This highlights the need for broader, more representative datasets.</li> </ul> <h2 id="future-directions">Future Directions</h2> <p>To extend this project, I would:</p> <ul> <li>Consider hybrid techniques.</li> <li>Compare the results with the published articles on the same dataset.</li> <li>Increase the training set size.</li> <li>Integrate <strong>Explainable AI tools</strong> (like SHAP or LIME) so clinicians can understand <em>why</em> the model makes predictions.</li> <li>Expand the dataset with multi-institutional records for stronger generalization.</li> <li>Explore <strong>deep learning models</strong> for non-linear relationships and time-series clinical data.</li> </ul> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>This project shows the potential of machine learning in assisting with early heart disease detection. While the results are promising, clinical deployment would require larger datasets, rigorous testing, and interpretability.</p> <p>For me, the key takeaway was how much value comes from following a <strong>research mindset</strong>: clearly defining the problem, testing multiple approaches, validating results, and critically reflecting on their implications.</p> <p>📄 You can <a href="https://github.com/cliffordEmmanuel/heart-disease-prediction/blob/main/Heart-disesase-prediction-report.pdf">view the full research report here</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Clifford</name></author><category term="ml"/><category term="regression"/><category term="classification"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can Machine Learning Help Predict Heart Disease?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Predicting House Prices; MLR vs RFR</title><link href="https://cliffordemmanuel.github.io//blog/2025/regression-comparative-analysis/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Predicting House Prices; MLR vs RFR"/><published>2025-01-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://cliffordemmanuel.github.io//blog/2025/regression-comparative-analysis</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cliffordemmanuel.github.io//blog/2025/regression-comparative-analysis/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="predicting-house-prices-mlr-vs-rfr">Predicting House Prices: MLR vs RFR</h1> <p>Housing markets are notoriously complex.

In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.
