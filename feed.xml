Early diagnosis can save lives, but traditional methods of risk assessment often depend on limited clinical tests or subjective interpretation. With the growing availability of health data, I wanted to explore whether <strong>machine learning (ML) techniques</strong> could assist in predicting heart disease risk more accurately.</p> <p>This post summarizes my project: applying different ML algorithms to a clinical dataset to see how well they could predict the presence of heart disease.</p> <h2 id="the-dataset">The Dataset</h2> <p>I used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle containing <strong>1,025 anonymized patient records</strong>. Each record included <strong>13 clinical features</strong> (like age, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, ECG results, maximum heart rate, etc.) and a target label indicating whether the patient had heart disease.</p> <p>Why this dataset?</p> <ul> <li>It’s a standard benchmark for healthcare ML experiments.</li> <li>The size (1k+ records) is manageable yet complex enough to apply multiple techniques.</li> <li>It includes both categorical and numerical features, which means meaningful preprocessing steps are required.</li> </ul> <h2 id="approach">Approach</h2> <p>I followed a typical <strong>data science workflow</strong>:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong></p> <ul> <li>Visualized feature distributions and checked correlations.</li> <li>Found that some features (e.g., chest pain type, thalassemia, maximum heart rate) strongly correlated with heart disease.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Preprocessing:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Handled categorical features through encoding.</li> <li>Scaled numerical features to a common range to help algorithms like SVM and KNN.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Modeling:</strong> I compared four algorithms:</p> <ul> <li>Logistic Regression (baseline)</li> <li>Random Forest (ensemble method)</li> <li>K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)</li> <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM with RBF kernel)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Evaluation:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Used accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.</li> <li>Applied <strong>5-fold cross-validation</strong> and <strong>GridSearchCV</strong> for hyperparameter tuning.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <h2 id="results">Results</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Random Forest</strong> was the clear winner, achieving <strong>~99.7% accuracy</strong> and perfect scores on precision, recall, and F1.</li> <li><strong>SVM</strong> also performed strongly with ~91.7% accuracy and high ROC-AUC.</li> <li>Logistic Regression and KNN gave reasonable baselines but underperformed compared to ensemble methods.</li> </ul> <p>Interestingly, the most predictive features included:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Chest pain type</strong> (certain types highly associated with disease).</li> <li><strong>Maximum heart rate achieved</strong> (higher stress response linked to risk).</li> <li><strong>Number of major vessels</strong> and <strong>thalassemia type</strong> (clear clinical indicators).</li> </ul> <h2 id="insights">Insights</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Ensemble models like Random Forest excelled</strong> because they can capture complex feature interactions without heavy assumptions.</li> <li><strong>Cross-validation was critical</strong> — early models showed near-perfect scores that looked like overfitting, but validation confirmed generalizability.</li> <li>Some findings challenged medical intuition, such as younger patients showing more heart disease in this dataset. This highlights the need for broader, more representative datasets.</li> </ul> <h2 id="future-directions">Future Directions</h2> <p>To extend this project, I would:</p> <ul> <li>Consider hybrid techniques.</li> <li>Compare the results with the published articles on the same dataset.</li> <li>Increase the training set size.</li> <li>Integrate <strong>Explainable AI tools</strong> (like SHAP or LIME) so clinicians can understand <em>why</em> the model makes predictions.</li> <li>Expand the dataset with multi-institutional records for stronger generalization.</li> <li>Explore <strong>deep learning models</strong> for non-linear relationships and time-series clinical data.</li> </ul> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>This project shows the potential of machine learning in assisting with early heart disease detection. While the results are promising, clinical deployment would require larger datasets, rigorous testing, and interpretability.</p> <p>For me, the key takeaway was how much value comes from following a <strong>research mindset</strong>: clearly defining the problem, testing multiple approaches, validating results, and critically reflecting on their implications.</p> <p>📄 You can <a href="https://github.com/cliffordEmmanuel/heart-disease-prediction/blob/main/Heart-disesase-prediction-report.pdf">view the full research report here</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Clifford</name></author><category term="ml"/><category term="regression"/><category term="classification"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can Machine Learning Help Predict Heart Disease?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Predicting House Prices; MLR vs RFR</title><link href="https://cliffordemmanuel.github.io//blog/2025/regression-comparative-analysis/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Predicting House Prices; MLR vs RFR"/><published>2025-01-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://cliffordemmanuel.github.io//blog/2025/regression-comparative-analysis</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cliffordemmanuel.github.io//blog/2025/regression-comparative-analysis/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="predicting-house-prices-mlr-vs-rfr">Predicting House Prices: MLR vs RFR</h1> <p>Housing markets are notoriously complex. Prices depend on dozens of factors: location, size, condition, and sometimes even unpredictable trends. As a data science project, I set out to explore whether machine learning could help us predict house prices more accurately.</p> <h2 id="the-dataset">The Dataset</h2> <p>I used the <strong>King County housing dataset</strong> (Seattle, USA), which contains <strong>21,613 records</strong> of house sales.

But first I’ll show some of the mindset changes I had to make…</em></p> <h4>System vs Goals</h4> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*zdHgcDW8Gbgrgtmwk1LxAg.jpeg"/></figure> <p>It is way easy to set goals. Just like those new year resolutions, you start out full of motivation and you’re so sure of yourself. Then somewhere in the middle, the motivation starts to wane and soon you’re back to square one.</p> <p>After failing this way multiple times, I realised my idea of setting goals needed to change. James Clear puts it this way in his book Atomic Habits:</p> <blockquote><em>“Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.”</em></blockquote> <p>Goals become your destination and the system becomes the small consistent actions taken to reach there. Your next thought the moment you start thinking about a goal should be:</p> <ul><li>What system can I create?</li><li>What small actions can I plan to take consistently in order to hit my goal?</li></ul> <p>Thinking in terms of systems also means you need sufficient information about the goal in order to create the required small actions that can be repeated over time.</p> <h4>Deep work</h4> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tKv53w9Q_Pk8sAbeQ9kTgQ.jpeg"/></figure> <p>Author Cal Newport defines the Deep work principle as follows:</p> <blockquote>“Deep work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill and are hard to replicate.”</blockquote> <p>Our world has become increasingly full of distractions. I can’t count how many times, I found myself stuck in twitter’s infinite scroll, mindlessly thumbing through IG post after post, one youtube video after the other. then hours pass by and guilt creeps in.</p> <p>For you to achieve the needed results, you need some alone, distraction-free time where you can have an unbroken concentration. You need to fight for it and be bullish about not giving up that time to any other thing.</p> <h4>The knowledge journey</h4> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vM7RwB9SvH9aeTr9RVEl2A.gif"/></figure> <p>The knowledge journey is a long one and I found that at any point along the way these things will be true:</p> <ul><li>There will be things that you know ie. <em>knowns</em></li><li>There will be things that you know you don’t know ie. <em>known unknowns</em></li><li>There will be things you don’t even know you don’t know ie. <em>unknown unknowns.</em></li></ul> <p>It is said that a problem identified is a problem half-solved. So knowing which position on this journey you’re starting from provides some clarity on what you need to do.</p> <p>Coming to the realization that for anything I’m about to learn, I will feel pretty dumb in the beginning was reassuring and helped me to be less self-critical and patient.</p> <p><em>So here are some pointers to consider if you’re seeking to have a learning habit.</em></p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dgJ3sZLL1Mndo6KaEpBlBg.jpeg"/><figcaption>Source: Wikipedia</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>If you’re already in a tech role…You’re an apprentice!</strong></p> <p>Even before you start thinking that you need to do a side project or buy an online course. Don’t underestimate the things you’re learning on your day-to-day. Just don’t write it off.</p> <p>Ask a lot of questions ie Why was the code written this way? Why are they using this tech stack? If you’re dealing with a code base, track commit history on a script to see how a particular feature evolved.</p> <p>Find a way to keep track of your learnings. The knowledge you gained through experience sticks the best!! For me I found this approach for tracking my learnings:</p> <ul><li>Maintaining handy code snippets on a notes application.<em> (I use notion but any tool works, rather than getting attached to a particular tool it is best to use something you’re familiar with that you can use to quickly document and easily retrieve.)</em></li><li>Doing a Twitter thread of something I solved or a new tool I picked up. <em>(Well you’re already spending time there, so why don’t you start a nice thread on how you solved a problem??)</em></li><li>Blogging. Just writing stuff down and sharing it!</li></ul> <blockquote>Bottom line is, documenting is a great way to reinforce what you learn.</blockquote> <p><strong>A Learning Proof of Concept (POC)</strong></p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*yUnJ6yQLrY5XODS3zW7Exw.jpeg"/><figcaption>Yep let’s learn from salt bae Ha!!</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Another strategy I found really cool was the idea of a ‘learning’ PoC.</em></p> <p>Learning a language or a new framework or tool can be daunting but a PoC gives you an opportunity just to try a small part of it out. It is experimental, and you quickly get some form of instant gratification and a sense of what you can achieve with the new information gathered from the experimentation.</p> <p>For instance, in order to learn how to build a Flask web app. Rather than thinking about first taking a long course. (which is the most logical thing I will do!) I’ll just take a youtube video and code along while the guy over the internet builds. Then after completing it, I have an idea of what don’t know and then I know where to search to fill those gaps.</p> <p><strong>Structure Structure Structure!!</strong></p> <p>If you’re starting out as a novice, because you don’t have a lot of information, you’re likely to set lofty, uninformed goals and be overwhelmed and discouraged when they are not met.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*8wPDx4RjGbUmYTTYnB74sQ.gif"/><figcaption>yeah, we’ve all been there Homer!</figcaption></figure> <p>I found that usually what is needed is a map to follow, not necessarily a full map but at the very least, a defined start and middle. You need to be able to gather sufficient information, so you can refine your goal and carve out a system to help you achieve it. The best way I’ve found to get that structure is from current practitioners.</p> <p>Imagine you’re working as a lab technician, and you want to transition into a data analyst role. The first thing you need to find is a current data analyst. And this is where the internet shines; A quick tweet asking for anyone to guide you, A quick search on LinkedIn, a google search for communities in your locality where you can find support, subreddits, quora forums the list goes on. But don’t forget your goal when you’re searching, people easily get caught up in this cycle of connecting with others but not making the most of it.</p> <p>Also, most online courses on Udemy, Udacity, Coursera etc have a well-outlined curriculum to give a sense of what needs to be learnt from beginning to end. If you don’t have the money to buy the course, you can document that curriculum and turn to google for each concept. <em>(I did this a couple of times too)</em></p> <blockquote>You want structure! and once you get that the responsibility rests on you to design your system and start committing to it.</blockquote> <h3>Tying it all together</h3> <p>A series of questions you can ask yourself when you want to build a learning routine:</p> <ol><li>What is the goal?<br/>- Who do I want to become? <br/>- What do I want to achieve?</li><li>What is the system?<br/>- What do I need to know in order to design the system?<br/>- Where can I get that information?<br/>- Who can I reach out to? <br/>- What’s my life like now? current schedule, what times am I free?<br/>- What should I be able to do after a time period?<br/>- How can I show what I’ve done?</li></ol> <blockquote><em>Building a learning routine is a habit and this doesn’t fall into place in a day not even in weeks. Start small and try to achieve consistency. You’re likely to be overwhelmed at some point, maybe miss a few takes. Don’t let the guilt get to you just focus on the next take.</em></blockquote> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/773/1*M88zND4y2ITf8LopNRBMUw.png"/><figcaption>Source: Atomic Habits, James Clear, pg 17</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Well, nothing more to be said here.

I wake up reluctantly from sleep to begin a now unconscious routine: wash my face, grab a cup of coffee and head for my study desk. I start my day with a bible meditation and study session. All goes well until an email alert from a priority account: “ Airflow alert: &lt;Taskinstance: … [failed]&gt;…”</em></p> <p><em>“Oh! not again!”; I exclaim, and the rest of my morning routine goes awry as I struggle to figure out what could have gone wrong.</em></p> <p>So, I took up the role of monitoring and maintaining the airflow jobs prepared by the engineering team. Over time, I have encountered too many scenarios like the one described above that challenged my perception of handling failures.</p> <p>In this article, I will communicate two things:</p> <ul><li>A mindset change.</li><li>A framework for handling failures.</li></ul> <h3>Mindset change</h3> <h4><strong>1. Things can go wrong</strong></h4> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/850/1*nAqQcEuEkFrUkZPU6Mng2w.jpeg"/></figure> <p>I used to feel very disappointed when a job I created failed. I thought it was an indictment against my competence. But one of the first things I observed in the more senior members of my team is they were always more relaxed when errors popped up.</p> <p>Suffice it to say, I understood that Edward Murphy was right. Developing a mindset that things can go wrong helped me achieve two things:</p> <ul><li>I began to write more failure proof scripts(if you work with redshift you’d understand that this,… well the least said the better)</li><li>I was less critical of myself when my scripts failed. I took it as an opportunity to learn more about the system and write better code.</li></ul> <blockquote>That, things can go wrong, may seem like a pessimistic stance but you are more likely to improve faster by learning from your failures than you would from your successes.</blockquote> <h4>2. No blame games!</h4> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/421/1*97RjdDw_-GlYc3pilTWsqA.jpeg"/></figure> <p>Nobody likes to have their daily routine disrupted because some pipelines decided to fail. You are likely to be grumpy and look for someone or something to chew up; fair enough. But it does not do much good.</p> <p>In the event of a failure, what you do not want to do is look for someone to blame. Instead, focus on; finding out what the incident is, its impact and the resolution.</p> <p>People naturally become defensive and are likely to absolve themselves of any fault when things go wrong. Playing the blame game increases tension within the team and stops anyone from arriving at the root cause early enough.</p> <blockquote><em>Having mindset changes is one of the many internal work you should anticipate doing throughout your career. It provides a faster route to develop.</em></blockquote> <h3>A framework for handling failures.</h3> <p>One of the many lessons I learned from reading Matthew Syed’s book, <strong><em>Blackbox Thinking</em></strong> was that: <em>The way to improve the efficiency of any system is to learn from the times when the system failed. And that this usually requires that individuals and teams be objective enough to prevent emotions and ego from interfering.</em></p> <p>Over time I observed a practice among my engineering team, and I came up with a routine to help me handle the errors much more quickly. The following describes this further:</p> <p><strong><em>1. Do a preliminary analysis and gauge the impact of the error.</em></strong></p> <p><em>i. What job failed?</em></p> <p>The alert email and the generated logs will usually contain that information. (t<em>his assumes the logs are being written to the </em><strong><em>Airflow UI</em></strong><em> and that each task in the airflow job has the </em><strong><em>email_on_failure</em></strong><em> option set to True)</em></p> <p><em>ii. Are there dependent jobs?</em></p> <p>Here you want to quickly find out if other jobs depend on the output generated by the failed job. They could be a tableau report or a python script that handles some extra complex transformations. Finding out the dependent jobs helps you gauge which other systems will be affected.</p> <p><strong><em>2. Communicate to stakeholders.</em></strong></p> <p>This step is vital as you want to be the first to highlight the problem before the business teams ring the alarm bells. Armed with the information gathered from the previous step, you can quickly draft a short message/email informing them of the error and the systems that are to be affected.</p> <p>Communicate to your engineering team as well.</p> <p><strong><em>3. Deep dive into the incident and work out the fix.</em></strong></p> <p>In this step, you identify the root cause and work out a fix. The time spent here depends on the error and perhaps technical skills but be sure to collaborate with a teammate as soon as you are stuck. Don’t forget that the goal is to arrive at the root cause and work out a fix as soon as possible.</p> <p>When the fix has been tested and applied, communicate back to the engineering team and the business stakeholders.</p> <p><strong><em>4. Document, document, document!</em></strong></p> <p>I must admit this is the hardest and most mundane step. After resolving the error and applying the fix, the last thing you want to do is prepare a write-up.</p> <p>But this is a vital component because errors reveal faults. They are like feedback mechanisms that show you where the problem was. By documenting, you expose that new knowledge for posterity. I think that’s why StackOverflow will forever remain a gold mine.</p> <p>Aim for brevity. The documentation should contain:</p> <ul><li>What the error was, add screenshots where available.</li><li>What was the root cause?</li><li>The fix that was applied.</li><li>Any recommendation to prevent future occurrence.</li></ul> <p>In concluding, accepting that things can sometimes go wrong and not looking for someone to blame when they do, can be a game-changer.</p> <p>So when the error alerts pop up, you can run through this process:</p> <ol><li><strong><em>Do a preliminary analysis and gauge the impact of the error.</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Communicate to stakeholders.</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Deep dive into the incident and work out the fix.</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Document, document, document!</em></strong></li></ol> <p>I admit this may seem like a lot of work. But, you are likely to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying tech architecture. And perhaps more importantly, this can also reveal to me how deeply connected your work is with the rest of the business.</p> <p>And as if by some miracle, we now receive fewer error alerts.</p> <p><em>I found this </em><a href="https://medium.com/startup-stash/how-to-avoid-firefighting-for-data-engineers-ea433b17ea9e"><em>article</em></a><em> by </em><a href="https://medium.com/u/7d379e0b2f59"><em>Kiana Alessandra Villaera</em></a><em> on how to mitigate against fixing bugs for Data engineers.

Finally, I was going to test my scripting skills in a business environment, I thought to myself.</p> <p>My focus was simple too; write better and more efficient scripts and write them faster.</p> <p>After 6 months my perspectives have changed quite a bit, although I’m well on my way to reaching my initial goal, I’ve had to unlearn and pick up some new behaviour.</p> <p><em>The following is my attempt to articulate some of the lessons learned, some quite the hard way. So here goes, in no particular order:</em></p> <h3>Understand the business context.</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/636/1*1fzXjh31I2UHsJDKeL9K-A.jpeg"/><figcaption>context is everything</figcaption></figure> <p>I had read countless blogs posts on data engineering that stressed its importance but it never really quite dawned till I found myself on the job.</p> <p>I quickly found that the data engineering role meant, you’re going to be at the receiving end of the majority of the data that is used by the company, data really really familiar to them.</p> <p>I know the temptation is to jump right into the coding but do spend some time to get familiar with the operations of the various departments.</p> <blockquote>Learn the terminologies, understand what the abbreviations represent, identify the metrics and KPIs that will be thrown around you.</blockquote> <h3>The entire codebase can be initially daunting!</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/278/1*GeJoSQ-VMiP00pgY7dL6ZQ.jpeg"/><figcaption>confused?</figcaption></figure> <p>I was a little over-ambitious when I began, I set off to try to understand the entire code-base no matter the cost.</p> <p>A noble cause yes but reality slowly dawned on me that business wasn’t going to slow down for me to catch up. And I ended up over-exerting time and energy trying to satisfy my curiosity which was still painfully short.</p> <p>I learned a key lesson though, focus on the business use case rather than the fine details of the code. Every project folder, script or query addresses a specific use case and wading through the code base with that as a guide can help you quickly make sense of the code little by little. Then over time as you complete more tasks, you build a better intuition of the code.</p> <blockquote>So take it slow, you’re not expected to have the entire codebase in your head. Just focus on knowing enough so you know where to look.</blockquote> <h3>Ask. Ask. Ask!</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/798/1*miH5hBHWnHexrT518W2Kyw.jpeg"/><figcaption>ask</figcaption></figure> <p><em>It doesn’t mean you’re dumb!</em></p> <p>This hurt me one time when I completed a ticket late because I felt it was my responsibility to figure out any confusion by myself.</p> <p>After failing on this several times I learned the approach of typing a quick summary after each project meeting and sharing it with the stakeholder.</p> <p>Aim to seek clarity before undertaking any assigned task. Engage the task issuer as soon as soon can be, jump on a quick call if you have to. It really shows you’re paying attention and you will deliver on tasks much much faster.</p> <blockquote>So brace yourself to be naive and painfully clueless at times. Don’t try to understand everything on your own, ask ask and ask!</blockquote> <h3>You will make mistakes, Just own it!</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*Qi2g39H8tuT7fE5bB33hxw.jpeg"/><figcaption>i made a mistake</figcaption></figure> <p>When I started, I put an unhealthy amount of pressure on myself to prove my worth. So much so that anytime I made a mistake or do something terribly wrong, I began to doubt my competence.</p> <p>Things happen yes just don’t beat yourself over it!</p> <blockquote>Expect to make mistakes every once in a while but focus on owning them. I found that this was a much faster approach to making fewer mistakes overall.</blockquote> <p>Owning your mistake means alerting your team as soon as possible and providing solutions to fix it, so it can be corrected.</p> <blockquote>Saying: “it is my fault” is not that hard and you quickly become a more trustworthy person in your team.</blockquote> <h3>Say something!</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*a9Ls50qF6Ec2TFBOKyScTw.jpeg"/><figcaption>please say something</figcaption></figure> <p>I struggled with this initially, I just wanted to work in my small corner and produce the needed output, but I quickly found that my outputs as a data engineer depended on the inputs of several others and so it wasn’t that prudent.</p> <blockquote>Giving periodic updates to your stakeholders is one of the surest proofs that you’re working.</blockquote> <p>Communicate blockers too, you do not only yourself but your team and sometimes the larger business a disservice if you fail to communicate blockers in a timely manner.</p> <p>This was hard for me because I saw it as defeat if I communicated my blockers but yeah things caught up to me fast. So I developed a system for asking for help:</p> <ul><li>For code blockers, I give myself up to 3 hours then I ask for help.</li><li>For issues with clarity of task requirements, I raise the flag immediately.</li></ul> <p>Well, I’m getting better at this, but yeah, communicate, communicate communicate.</p> <h3><strong>Learn more about yourself</strong></h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/850/1*qkg-yVB8S5Qd0drvAxhQCg.jpeg"/></figure> <p>June 2022 will mark my 3rd active working year since I graduated. So I still think it’s the early days in my career. There’s a great deal more I can know, and I feel I’m only getting started.</p> <p>During my culture fit interview session, I stumbled on a question on work-life balance. I hadn’t considered this before. So I didn’t really know what an ideal working environment looked like. So this lesson was perhaps the most important lesson I had to learn: <strong>Know thyself!!</strong></p> <p>Capture the feedback that will be communicated to you, take them in your stride and keep on moving.</p> <p>Learn about yourself, be intentional about identifying what works for you; Maybe you’d find that your day gets messed up if you respond to emails early morning, Or that you thrive with minimal supervision than micromanaging, Or that you tend to do great work when there are no distractions around.</p> <p>Whatever it is, learn about yourself and use that to plan your working day.</p> <blockquote>Over time you’re going to build a great intuition, which would help inform your next career step.</blockquote> <p>Finally, I really think it is a long road to mastery, and it takes time to build competency. So slow down, browse through some programming memes and laugh at yourself every once in a while.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/623/1*XmfoR9O0mZcjC5FtdevjzQ.jpeg"/></figure> <p><em>PS: If you want a quick intro to Data Engineering do check this </em><a href="https://clifflolo.medium.com/what-in-the-world-is-data-engineering-56a18610d1ba"><em>post</em></a><em> by a good </em><a href="https://clifflolo.medium.com/"><em>colleague</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>Hope you enjoyed this.<br/>Cheers!!</p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=10692d525cb9" width="1" height="1" alt=""/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="external-posts"/><category term="medium"/></entry><entry><title type="html">Basic repetitive linux cmds</title><link href="https://cliffordemmanuel.github.io//blog/2021/linux-cmds/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Basic repetitive linux cmds"/><published>2021-08-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-08-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://cliffordemmanuel.github.io//blog/2021/linux-cmds</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cliffordemmanuel.github.io//blog/2021/linux-cmds/"><![CDATA[<p>Here I’ll just log all the basic linux commands I’ve had to type several times.</p> <h4 id="list-directory-contents">list directory contents</h4> <ul> <li>show the hidden files: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -a</code></li> <li>show the file permissions, owners, filesize, created timestamp, filename: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -l</code></li> <li>show the contents order by creation timestamp desc <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -lt</code></li> </ul>]]></content><author><name>Clifford</name></author><category term="linux"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here I’ll just log all the basic linux commands I’ve had to type several times.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Weird SQLAlchemy error passing a query with python</title><link href="https://cliffordemmanuel.github.io//blog/2021/sqlalchemy-error/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Weird SQLAlchemy error passing a query with python"/><published>2021-08-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-08-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://cliffordemmanuel.github.io//blog/2021/sqlalchemy-error</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cliffordemmanuel.github.io//blog/2021/sqlalchemy-error/"><![CDATA[<p>I ran into an issue one time where a query which worked fine on dbeaver through a weird error when a python script that ran it failed on the remote server.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>Error message was something along these lines: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TypeError: 'dict' object does not support indexing</code>.</p> <p><br/> After some digging I found the issue had to do with my use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code> in several case statements.
